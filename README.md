Written as an absolutely useful project during the corona crisis in April 2020.
I started real programming in this language around 2002, when I was 12 years old.
BB is really not perfect for stuff like this, but it was fun coming back :)

You can use blitz3d-ng to run it

Also a shoutout and thanks to the blitzforum.de community!
There I was able to make my first steps as a programmer, chasing my dreams of creating the games I always wanted to play :)

This piece of software creates a feedforward neural network.
The network has several layers and several nodes.
For the value of every node is the weighted sum of the outputs of all nodes of the previous layer, put through an activation function.
Stuff you can play aroud with easily is marked with CHANGEME.
